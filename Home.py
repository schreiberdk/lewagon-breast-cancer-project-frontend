    This LeWagon Data Science and AI Coding Bootcamp project focuses on improving breast cancer detection and localization using AI models on mammography images.

    We develop two core models:
    - **Classification model:** Determines whether cancer is present in a mammogram.
    - **Segmentation model:** Identifies the precise location of cancer by segmenting the affected areas.

    Additionally, we provide an interactive tool where users can:
    - Draw their own cancer mask on a mammogram.
    - Compare their mask against the labeled ground truth mask.
    - Evaluate their results using the Intersection over Union (IoU) score.

    **üëà Select a page from the sidebar** to try the diagnosis tool, draw masks, or explore model performance.
